ADVANCED TRACK ONLY
----------------------------------------------------------
The explicit Judging & Grading Criteria to guide your submission will be released by 9AM PST tomorrow.
These 3 Rules are essential to note regarding the Data:
----------------------------------------------------------
1. You must use some portion of the NYISO dataset whether its Load Data, Power Grid Data, Pricing Data, or some combination of them.
2. This Datathon allows any outside dataset to be used in conjunction with the NYISO dataset to help augment your understanding, tell a more in depth story, discover novel insights, to utilize one of the partner's tools to a fuller capacity, etc.
3. If you find & decide to use another dataset, you must share it with all the teams in the slack channel #advanced-track. If you neglect to do so in a timely fashion your submission will be disqualified.
----------------------------------------------------------
The Galvanize Datathon is an "Open" Datathon, meaning the perspective you decide to take will inform your solution and the grading/judging is flexible to accommodate varying approaches.
For example you can approach this from a COVID perspective, a Renewable Energy/Green New Deal Perspective, A Free Market Perspective, An Energy Price Minimization Perspective, A Climate Change Perspective, A Price/Load Prediction Perspective, etc.
The most creative and effective use of the data, the most effective use of our partnerâ€™s technologies, and the clearest submission & presentation of your findings will earn you the top prize.
The explicit Judging & Grading Criteria to guide your submission will be released by 9AM PST tomorrow.
----------------------------------------------------------
Here are some of the many directions you might decide to pursue during this Datathon:
A time series analysis to predict power usage
Optimize for and strategize to lower electricity cost. For instance "load data" will influence "price data" especially at different times of day. Using electricity at night could be cheaper.
Overlaying social media posts of NY residents with power outages or other impacts shown by the power data.
How can the centralized NY power grid compare to electricity prices in different places across the nation (potentially including a private market comparison with Texas)
Renewable energy perspective: partition how much energy is due to coal burning, nuclear, wind, etc. You can go further and try to investigate and analyze the process of upgrading to renewable energies. You can estimate what the renewable grid load is.
What is the impact COVID has had on the electricity usage.
Utilizing a graph database to build connections between entities you can create a simulation of 'agents' that can behave as 'pseudo-consumers' of a power plant and model their behavior with a graph database.
Creation of a Twitter bot that is linked to NYISO to produce an automated output for contextualized information to residents of different regions or area codes based on the load. For instance if the load dips below a certain threshold an automated twitter bot for the NYC area code will inform residents that Power Usage will be restricted and rolling blackouts will occur.
MANY OTHER CREATIVE OPTIONS! THINK BIG! YOU HAVE A WEEK!
----------------------------------------------------------
You may need external data for many of these approaches, it is not required and submissions can use only the NYISO dataset(s).
Once again this is a reminder that all outside datasets must be posted publicly in the #advanced-track channel in a timely fashion so that others may use the dataset as well. Failure to do so will disqualify this dataset from being used in your submission.

Below is the link to the Judging & Grading Rubric, be sure to inspect it to assess where you should spend your time to maximize your chances to win. Here is a brief overview:
Points are awarded at the discretion of the Judge, below are suggestions
to aid in determining the final percentage of awarded points.
0 points: No attempt
20% of Points: Attempt is wildly inaccurate or way off base
40% of Points: Emerging results, but needs significant improvement; does not demonstrate success
60% of Points: May be missing some criteria, but demonstrates some successful results
80% of Points: Largely complete and successful; minor adjustments possible
100% of Points: All criteria demonstrated; goes above and beyond effort expected
Maximum possible points: 
Github: 50
Presentation: 40
Creativity: 10
Total: 100
+2 points for each Eligible Partner's Platform/Tool Used
Up to a Maximum of +8 bonus points for all Partner Platform/Tools used
